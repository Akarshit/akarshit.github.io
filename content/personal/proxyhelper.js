      <h2> The Problem </h2>
      It's a real pain to check which wi-fi is working and which is not. Also we are always skeptical if we are connected to the fastest network that is available. 
      Also when one is behind proxy server, many application stop working as they need a direct connection.
      When tor is used proxy setting have to be changed, this becomes very irritating very quickly.
